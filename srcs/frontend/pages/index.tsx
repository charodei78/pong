      <p>
        Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple
        two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released
        in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan
        Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan
        Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by
        the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game
        included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In
        response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.
