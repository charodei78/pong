## Overview
In this subject, you will need to build a website for the mighty pong contest.  
Your website will help users play pong against each other.  
There will be an admin view, chat with moderators, real-time multiplayer online
games.  
You will need to follow those rules:
* you must use the last stable version of every framework or library.
* Your website backend should be written in NestJS.
* You must use a PostgreSQL database and no other databases.
* The front end must be written with any typescript framework.
* Your website should be a single page app, but the user should be able to use the back button on the browser https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlepage_application
* Your website must be usable on the latest version to date on Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
* There must be no unhandled errors or warnings when browsing through the website.
* You can use any library.
* Everything should run with a single call to `docker-compose up â€“build`

## Security concerns
Because you are creating a fully working website, there are a few security concerns that you will have to tackle
* Any password stored in your database must be encrypted
* Your website must be protected against SQL injections
* You must implement some kind of server-side validation for forms and any user input

## User Account
* A user must log in using the OAuth system of 42 intranet
* A user must be able to choose a unique name that will be displayed on the website
* A user has several victories and losses and other stats (ladder level, achievements etc...)
* A user must have an avatar generated or uploaded by the user
* A user must be able to activate a 2-factor authentication (like google authenticator
or an SMS etc...)
* A user can add other users as friends, and see their current status (online, offline, in a game...)
* Each user has a match history (including duel, ladder) that can be consulted by anyone logged-in

## Chat
* Users must be able to create channels public/private or protected by a password
* Users must be able to send direct messages to other users
* Users must be able to block other user and therefore they will not see their messages anymore
* A user that creates a new channel is automatically its owner until he leaves the channel
  * owner of a channel can add/change/remove a password to access the channel
  * owner can select a user to be an administrator and is also an administrator of
the channel
    * administrator can ban or mute users for a certain amount of time
* Through the chat interface users should be able to ask other players to do a Pong match
* Through the chat interface users must be able to see other players profiles

## Game
* The main purpose of this website is to play pong against other players and show everyone how good you are!  
* Therefore we should be able to play pong directly on the website and live against another player.  
* There must be a match-making system, user can join a game queue and are automatically matched with another player.  
* It can be on a canvas or it can be with 3d effects, it can be ugly but it must be a pong like the one from 1972.  
* You need to have some game customization options (power-ups, different maps etc) but the user must be able to play a default pong game without any added stuff.  
* The game must be responsive!  
* Think about network issues, like disconnects or lag. The user experience should be the best possible.  
* Other users can watch the game live without interfering in it.
